## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

This was great practice for react, I've been working on much larger projects and geting a little lost, especially trying to just have one button state onClick. This is a great project to look back to while I'm still learning react and getting overloaded.
